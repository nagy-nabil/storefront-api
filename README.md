# STOREFRONT-FWD

## INSTALLATION
1. ### you must get [postgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed in your machine 
    **create the database and then install the uuid extension because we're using it as our id for all tables**
    ```
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
    ```
2. ### install all npm packages
    ```
    npm install
    ```
3. ### setup the .env file from [environment-variables](#environment-variables) section
    >note without .env file you can not connect to the database neither running tests or run migrations
4. ### run database migrations
    ```
    db-migrate up
    ```
    **note if db-migrate is not defined in your terminal install it as global from npm then try again**
    ```
    npm i -g db-migrate
    ```
5. ### build javascript files
    ```
    npm run build
    ```
6. ### run tests
    ```
    npm run test
    ```
7. ### start the server
    ```
    npm start
    ```
## privileges 
> note that database must be shipped with already exist admin [it's done when you start the server for the first time or start testing]
    [```
